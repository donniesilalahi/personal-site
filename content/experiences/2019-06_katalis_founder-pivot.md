## About

One of the 20+ fellows selected for the Southeast Asia program.

## Contribution logs

My team of 4 was exploring ways to help migrant workers intra-ASEAN to achieve financial independence faster

- Researched root causes on why most migrant workers continue to do this kind of work despite earning higher income compared to living cost in their hometown
- Discovered that (1) most remittances sent back home by the migrant workers were not put into good use by their trustees
- Explored the idea of `earmarked` remittance — where instead of pure cash — it's a mix of money, food packages, children school fees, utility bill payments, saving products, etc
- Interviewed few migrant workers in their day-off around the Paya Lebar square
- Designed and developed the high-fidelity prototypes using Adobe XD
- Plan the pitching outline and design the deck

## Other works contributed by my teammates

- Engaged with one of the leading PPOB startup in Indonesia with retail networks across tier 2 and tier 3 cities
- Engaged with respectable migrant working recruitment agency that champion ethical practice

## Impact

- My team got invited to present our idea in other regional program
- My team praised for most well-defined solution
