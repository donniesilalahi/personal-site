## The Pitch
**Franchise marketplace**—open a franchise as easily as e-commerce checkout. End-to-end platform: discovery → safeguarded payments → virtual meetings → e-contracts. **2 weeks to operate**, not months.

## Key Results
- **Built full marketplace MVP** with Bubble.io for rapid iteration
- **40+ LOIs from franchise brands** (1,000+ outlets, $1.9M/mo revenue potential)
- **$300K purchase intent** via fake-door tests, lead magnets, webinars
- **Interviewed 30+ stakeholders**: franchisees, brands, cloud kitchen owners

## Awards & Recognition
- **Top 10**: Founderplus Incubation Batch III
- **Top 30 Finalist**: Lokalcorn Startup Competition (TribunNews/HP)  
- **Top 10 Finalist**: Indigo Hackathon SME (Telkom Ventures)

## Post-Mortem
**Inactive.** Strong prototype + traction, but rejected as "not venture-scale" (same model funded 2 batches later). **Lesson**: Prioritize scalable revenue like branch location finder over full platform.
