##### About

Instellar is one of Indonesia’s leading social enterprise incubators, supporting hundreds of impact-driven ventures.
I joined as the first hire in a new division exploring fresh revenue streams through impact consulting — a strategic shift from the company’s previous reliance on short-term management fees from sponsor-funded incubator programs. The goal was to build a more sustainable growth model for the organization.

##### Impact

Helped secure Instellar’s first two impact consulting projects, establishing a new line of business for the company.

##### Contributions

- Led two Social Return on Investment (SROI) studies.
- Initiated groundwork for the company’s B Corp Certification, conducting a baseline assessment to identify gaps, required documentation, and improvement areas.
- Designed the Social Lean Canvas, an adaptation of the Lean Canvas tailored for impact-driven ventures.
- Facilitated and co-designed Human-Centered Design (HCD) workshops for MSME beneficiaries, including curriculum and research templates.
- Produced creative assets for multiple incubation programs, supporting branding and participant engagement.
- Supported applicant screening for an incubation program, reviewing and shortlisting over 100+ ventures.

##### Reflections

This role shaped my understanding of how social impact and business viability intersect.
