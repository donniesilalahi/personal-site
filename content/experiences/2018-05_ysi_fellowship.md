##### About

Selected as one of 20+ fellows for the Young Sustainable Impact Southeast Asia (YSI SEA) program — a regional innovation initiative supporting young changemakers developing sustainable solutions.

##### Contributions

Worked in a team of four exploring ways to help intra-ASEAN migrant workers achieve financial independence faster.

- Researched why many Indonesian blue-collar foreign migrant workers continue renewing their overseas contracts — even after a decade of work and steady savings — yet remain far from financial freedom.  
- Discovered that most remittances sent back home were often misused or poorly managed by trustees, limiting their long-term impact.  
- Explored the concept of **earmarked remittances** — blending monetary transfers with in-kind value such as food packages, school fees, utility bill payments, and savings products.  
- Conducted field interviews with migrant workers during their day off at Paya Lebar Square, Singapore.  
- Designed and developed high-fidelity app prototypes using **Adobe XD**.  
- Planned the pitch storyline and created presentation materials for the demo session.  

##### Collaborations (by teammates)

- Partnered with a leading **PPOB** (Payment Point Online Bank) startup in Indonesia with retail networks across tier 2 and 3 cities.  
- Connected with a reputable **migrant worker recruitment agency** recognized for its ethical employment practices.  

##### Impact

- Our team was invited to present the idea in another regional innovation program.  
- Recognized as having one of the *most well-defined and practical solutions* among all teams.
