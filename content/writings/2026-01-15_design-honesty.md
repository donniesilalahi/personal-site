Good design isn't about trends — it's about honesty.

It's what happens when craft meets empathy. When you stop trying to impress and start trying to serve.

## The Honesty Test

Ask yourself: Would I use this? Not "would someone use this" — would *I*?

If the answer is no, you're not designing. You're decorating.

## Craft Meets Empathy

The best products I've used don't announce themselves. They just work. They anticipate needs before you know you have them.

That's not magic. That's empathy encoded into pixels and code.
