Are you living your dreams?

It's the question on the postcard. The question I ask myself every morning.

## The Honest Answer

Most days, the answer is "I'm working on it." That's okay. Dreams aren't destinations — they're directions.

## What Dreams Are Made Of

I used to think dreams were about achievement. Titles, numbers, recognition.

Now I think dreams are about alignment. Doing work that feels true. Building things that matter.

## The Daily Practice

Living your dreams isn't a one-time decision. It's a daily practice. Small choices that compound over time.

Every experiment. Every late night. Every "what if" that becomes "let's try."

That's how dreams become real.
