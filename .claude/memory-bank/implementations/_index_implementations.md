# Implementation Specifications

Minimal, searchable record of features built. Each spec uses product/feature-focused naming and follows [\_template_implementations.md](./_template_implementations.md).

| Spec | Status | Priority | Date |
|------|--------|----------|------|


---

**How to Use**: After implementing a feature, create a spec using [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md). Name it by what it does (e.g., `campaign-crud`, `user-authentication`), not by phase.
